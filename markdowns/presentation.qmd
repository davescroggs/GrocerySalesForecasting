## Introduction

-   Competition is to forecast item sales in 54 different grocery stores.

    -   4,100 sale items
    -   4.5 years, 125 million rows of training data
    -   Forecast period of 2 weeks past final training data

## Evaluation metric

## Models

## Results

Final model - Tuned XGBoost

-   Features modelled - item number, store number, temporal information (weekday, month, year), store type, store cluster, location (state)
-   hyper-parameters tuned: tree depth, min data points in a node, randomly sampled predictors
-   Model evaluation: nwrmsle = 0.696

## Residuals

-   Model tends to under-estimate the result
-   Stratification of residuals, particularly in higher unit sales

## Residual outliers

-   Holidays not included in model features
    -   Potential reason for some extreme outliers
-   Store results insensitive to increase in sales
-   Stores in 42, 49 large overestimates
    -   Only stores in Quito city, and Type C
    -   Both dummy features had high importance
