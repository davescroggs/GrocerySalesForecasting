## Introduction

Accurate forecasting of product sales is important to retail stores, as stated in the competition description:

> "*Predict a little over, and grocers are stuck with overstocked, perishable goods. Guess a little under, and popular items quickly sell out, leaving money on the table and customers fuming.*"

Competition is to forecast item sales in:

-   54 different grocery stores in 22 cities

-   4,100 sale items

-   4.5 years, 125 million rows of training data

-   Forecast period of 2 weeks past final training data

## Data

Competition model data is 7 tables, test/train containing the predictor variable and 5 other tables containing additional information.

| Table        |        Rows | Cols | Column names                                              |

## Evaluation metric

Normalized Weighted Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (NWRMSLE)

-   Weight (wi) are for perishable items (weight = 1.5), other items weight = 1

-   Metric accounts for predicting results of a varying order of magnitude

$$ NWRMSLE = \sqrt{ \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i \left( \ln(\hat{y}_i + 1) - \ln(y_i +1)  \right)^2  }{\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i}} $$

## Model approach

1.  Exploration of the training and auxiliary data sets

    + Explore the predictor variable

    + Explore the predictor relationship with other variables

2.  Build a simple model on one item

    -   Trial model algorithms

    -   Trial data pre-processing

    -   Test evaluation metric

    -   Feature engineering

    -   Model evaluation

3.  Expand simple model

    + Model family of items (bread/bakery)

    + Expand model features

    + Tune hyper-parameters

    + Detailed model evaluation

## Process

    - Early EDA memory limit issues
    - Proof of concept model
    + Predictor 

## Results

Final model - Tuned XGBoost

-   Features modelled - item number, store number, temporal information (weekday, month, year), store type, store cluster, location (state)
-   hyper-parameters tuned: tree depth, min data points in a node, randomly sampled predictors
-   Model evaluation: nwrmsle = 0.696

## Residuals

-   Model tends to under-estimate the result
-   Stratification of residuals, particularly in higher unit sales

## Residual outliers

-   Holidays not included in model features
    -   Potential reason for some extreme outliers
-   Store results insensitive to increase in sales
-   Stores in 42, 49 large overestimates
    -   Only stores in Quito city, and Type C
    -   Both dummy features had high importance

## Limitations

## Future work

## Production deployment considerations
