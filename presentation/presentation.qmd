## Introduction

Accurate forecasting of product sales is important to retail stores, as stated in the competition description:

> "*Predict a little over, and grocers are stuck with overstocked, perishable goods. Guess a little under, and popular items quickly sell out, leaving money on the table and customers fuming.*"

Competition is to forecast item sales in:

-   54 different grocery stores in 22 cities

-   4,100 sale items

-   4.5 years and 125 million rows of training data

-   Forecast period of 2 weeks past final training data

Teams given 3 months to produce their best result, uploaded via Kaggle

## Data

Competition model data is 7 tables, test/train containing the predictor variable and 5 other tables containing additional information.

| Table        |        Rows | Cols | Column names                                              |

## Evaluation metric

Normalized Weighted Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (NWRMSLE)

-   Weight (wi) are for perishable items (weight = 1.5), other items weight = 1

-   Metric accounts for predicting results of a varying order of magnitude

$$ NWRMSLE = \sqrt{ \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i \left( \ln(\hat{y}_i + 1) - \ln(y_i +1)  \right)^2  }{\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i}} $$

## Model approach

1.  Exploration of the training and auxiliary data sets

    -   Explore the predictor variable

    -   Explore the predictor relationship with other variables

2.  Build a simple model on one item

    -   Trial model algorithms

    -   Trial data pre-processing

    -   Test evaluation metric

    -   Feature engineering

    -   Model evaluation

3.  Expand simple model

    -   Model family of items (bread/bakery)

    -   Expand model features

    -   Tune hyper-parameters

    -   Detailed model evaluation

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Results
  
-   Clear day-of-week trends (autocorrelation)
-   Significant range in store sales (1-15 million units/year)
-   Item family types
    - A few types had a large proportion of all items

Issues
  
-   Early EDA memory limit issues
-   Number and range of unit sales made visualisation challenging


## First simple model

-   A single common bread/bakery item
-   83,500 rows of data

Results
  
-   Trialled 3 model recipes
    - Recipe 1: store number and temporal data
    - Recipe 2: store information (number, location, type, cluster and daily transactions) and temporal data
    - Recipe 3: As above and includes pay-day information
-   Trialled 2 model algorithms
    - Random forest
    - XGBoost
-   Model algorithms had similar accuracy
-   Recipe 2 had best accuracy

Issues
  
-   Random forest model fit times were long for the simple model

## Bakery/bread family model

-   A model fitting the bread/bakery item family

Results
  
-   XGBoost model and Full recipe from simple model used
-   Hyper-parameters tuned: tree depth, min data points in a node, randomly sampled predictors
-   Model evaluation: nwrmsle = 0.696 (good kaggle results \~ 0.50-0.53)

## Residuals

-   Model tends to under-estimate the result
-   Stratification of residuals, particularly in higher unit sales

![Residuals](../figures/final_model_residuals.jpeg){width="250px"}

## Residual outliers

-   Holidays not included in model features
    -   Potential reason for some extreme outliers
-   Store results insensitive to increase in sales
-   Stores in 42, 49 large overestimates
    -   Only stores in Quito city, and Type C
    -   Both dummy features had high importance

## Limitations

-   Detailed EDA was difficult due to:
    a) size of dataset
    b) diversity of product items
    c) time constraints
-   Model parameter (feature and hyper parameters) exploration limited
-   Holiday data detailed and complex (holiday transfers)
-   Items modelled were common - no new items/stores in test set
    - Method required for full data set

## Improvements/Future work

-   Explore poor prediction performance of stores 42, 49
-   Explore further feature engineering of bakery family model
    -   Holiday information
    -   Regional information
-   Further EDA on other item families
-   Further model hyper-parameter tuning
-   EDA of effect of oil price, promotions, and re-investigate pay-day impact
-   Investigate ARIMA model for temporal effects

## Production deployment considerations

-   New items/stores without history need coding
    -   Work required to develop an approach to estimating these events
-   Corporación Favorita work in 2 week horizons
    -   Regular model retraining (daily/weekly)
    -   Develop item forecast performance metric
        -   Continuous monitoring of results
    -   Monitor and log large model errors (new holidays)
