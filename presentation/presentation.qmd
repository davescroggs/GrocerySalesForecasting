## Introduction

Accurate forecasting of product sales is important to retail stores, as stated in the competition description:

> "*Predict a little over, and grocers are stuck with overstocked, perishable goods. Guess a little under, and popular items quickly sell out, leaving money on the table and customers fuming.*"

Competition is to forecast item sales in:

-   54 different grocery stores in 22 cities

-   4,100 sale items

-   4.5 years, 125 million rows of training data

-   Forecast period of 2 weeks past final training data

## Data

Competition model data is 7 tables, test/train containing the predictor variable and 5 other tables containing additional information.

## Evaluation metric

Normalized Weighted Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (NWRMSLE)

-   Weight (wi) are for perishable items (weight = 1.5), other items weight = 1

-   Metric accounts for predicting results of a varying order of magnitude

$$ NWRMSLE = \sqrt{ \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i \left( \ln(\hat{y}_i + 1) - \ln(y_i +1)  \right)^2  }{\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i}} $$

## Model approach

1.  Exploration of the training and auxiliary data sets

    -   Explore the predictor variable

    -   Explore the predictor relationship with other variables

2.  Build a simple model on one item

    -   Trial model algorithms

    -   Trial data pre-processing

    -   Test evaluation metric

    -   Feature engineering

    -   Model evaluation

3.  Expand simple model

    -   Model family of items (bread/bakery)

    -   Expand model features

    -   Tune hyper-parameters

    -   Detailed model evaluation

## Process

    - Early EDA memory limit issues
    - Proof of concept model
    - Model fit times were long for the simple model
    + Predictor 

## Results

Final model - Tuned XGBoost

-   Features modelled - item number, store number, temporal information (weekday, month, year), store type, store cluster, location (state)
-   hyper-parameters tuned: tree depth, min data points in a node, randomly sampled predictors
-   Model evaluation: nwrmsle = 0.696 (good kaggle results \~ 0.50-0.53)

## Residuals

-   Model tends to under-estimate the result
-   Stratification of residuals, particularly in higher unit sales

![Residuals](../figures/final_model_residuals.jpeg){width="250px"}

## Residual outliers

-   Holidays not included in model features
    -   Potential reason for some extreme outliers
-   Store results insensitive to increase in sales
-   Stores in 42, 49 large overestimates
    -   Only stores in Quito city, and Type C
    -   Both dummy features had high importance

## Limitations

-   Large data set meant:
    -   detailed EDA was difficult
    -   modelling times were long
-   Holiday data detailed and complex (holiday transfers)
-   Bakery/bread family didn't have new items - issue not accounted for

## Improvements/Future work

-   Explore poor prediction performance of stores 42, 49
-   Explore further feature engineering of bakery family model
    -   Holiday information
    -   Regional information
-   Further EDA on other item families
-   Further model hyper-parameter tuning
-   EDA of effect of oil price, promotions, and re-investigate pay-day impact

## Production deployment considerations

-   New items/stores without history need coding
    -   Work required to develop an approach to estimating these events
-   Corporación Favorita work in 2 week horizons
    -   Regular model retraining (daily)
